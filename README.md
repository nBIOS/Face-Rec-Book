Face-Rec-Book
=============

Here are the some of the python scripts that we used in our Face-Rec-Book programme. The only things that are missing is the code connecting all the scripts, the local server code and the GUI input for pictures. More information about the project can be found http://nbiosdk.wordpress.com/2014/05/04/face-rec-book/.

Feel free to edit and improve on anything you want.
